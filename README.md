# DateTime
The Most Complete DateTime Library for C++

This library is a fork from timofurrer's DateTime lib https://github.com/timofurrer/DateTime
It also uses CppFormat https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat because I love it :)

The Library is completely revamped, Can calculate date from any date provided.
It has all the comparison operators and can add/subtract/timespan from any date to any date.

Full code coverage (43 Tests) (google tests/gtest).

Feel free to do pull requests for code cleaning/Speed improovements,etc.
Enjoy.
